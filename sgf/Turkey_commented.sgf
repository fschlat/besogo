PW[Miloveam]PB[akuntay]WR[5d]BR[5d]DT[2022-10-18]PC[IGS-PandaNet]C[White: Frederic Schlattner (Switzerland)
Black: Altan Kuntay (Turkey)

It's always important to start with a win in the new season, so I reckon everyone took this encounter pretty seriously as it was the first one played in the 2022/23 season.

I'll do this commentary in a strange way. I'll do a first round of comments without AI followed by a second using AI Sensei. The hope would be that I'm able to identify some of the mistakes I made by my self. I'll try to give the current win percentage for white every 20 moves and compare it to the IA afterwards!

I only focus on mistakes above 2 points with IA. ]RE[W+Resign]

;B[cq]LB[qf:A]C[I suppose black can also answer at A. However an invasion at the san-san point is rarely a mistake. The question is now from which side to block, the left side is narrower so I'm choosing the bottom side. ]

;B[pc]C[IA: No big errors until here. Playing kosumi N16 is also alright, it would have been 0.5pts better to play an extension, see variation.]
(;W[md]
;B[mf]C[This move is joseki and quite important as it's getting black out in the middle, and prepares an attack on one of the white weak groups on the upper right. I'm not sure what the best move for white is, but playing low as in the game is probably not good as I'm getting pushed down subsequently. ]

;B[jd]LB[qj:A]C[Here black get's a good position. My stone at A clearly not well positioned (overconcentrated, it extends from a group of stones which is already alive), it would have been better positioned on the top. ]
;W[ke]C[Probably the only move?]
(;B[kd]C[I was happy when black played this move, as it forced me to connected my stones, pushing from the other side would have been tricky.

IA: Still no big mistake from either player. K15 would have been the IA move but only 0.5pts difference. ]
;W[le]
(;B[je]LB[ob:4][od:3][oe:2][pe:1][kg:A]TR[jd][kd]C[IA: Interesting. It seems that this move is -1.7pts compared to A (see variation). It's counter-intuitive as one would like to play from the weak group and the two marked stones seem definitly more in danger than the black group on the right. 
However white can alsways force the cut in sente playing the sequence 1-4, which means white will have the upper hand during the fight.]
;W[kg]
;B[jf]TR[fc]C[This move also losses 2.5pts. Playing F17 right away is stronger. Probably because black doesn't want to strenghten white's group.]
;W[lh]TR[lg]C[IA: Play bamboo joint instead.]
;B[ni]
;W[ih]LB[pe:A]TR[jd][kd][je][jf]C[It's difficult to tell who's better here. Black seems to have slightly more points, but has one weak group on the top and a cutting point at A.

Winrate: 50%
IA: White +4]

;W[kh]
;B[fc]LB[fd:B][gf:A]C[This move was not expected, I thought black would get out at A. However it's a quick move to get a base. White can lean on black by playing B, connecting his groups up.

IA: Indeed white needs to lean on black playing B. See variation for continuation.]
(;W[df]
;B[cf]
;W[hc]TR[hc][df]C[Move 48 seems a bit overplay, it should be possible to punish for black. 

IA: Past marked moves lost 3pts total, but it's fine. It's indeed a slight overplay.]
(;B[gd]C[IA: Biggest mistake so far, lossing 4-5pts. However it's hard to see, because playing the "correct" move involves a big trade, see variations.]

;W[gb]
;B[hf]
;W[fb]TR[ge][gf]C[It is a complicated sequence, I'll have a closer look with the IA. As long as the triangle stones for white are not captured this board position seems like a success for white! 

Winrate: 55-60%
IA: +8pts]
;B[gg]
;W[ff]
(;B[ef]TR[fc][fd][gd][fe]C[IA: this was actually close to the loosing move. Black cannot lose the four stones, as white is not fully alive on the top (see variation). White wins by 20pts, so I'll stop IA analysis here. ]

;B[hh]LB[cg:A][dh:B][ij:C]C[Pretty forced until here. A, B are two weaknesses that white can use, and maybe he should push once at B right away. Black C seems like a big move though, as it encloses white on a big scale that's why I played it.]
;W[ij]
(;B[dn]C[Once again interesting decision from my opponent to cut right know. See variation.]

;W[mj]TR[pe]C[The cutting point at Q15 represents a big liability, as white will lose tempo during the fight being forced to connect. ]
